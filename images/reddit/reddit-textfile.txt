REDDIT



RESOURCES:
- just for numbers to use: https://foundationinc.co/lab/reddit-statistics/
- the Exponent video was actually not that great



REQUIREMENTS:
1. users can make posts
2. upvotes & downvotes on the posts of other users
3. a) view/read "TOP" posts list
   b) view/read "NEW" posts list
   c) view/read "HOT" posts list


OUT OF SCOPE:
- comments on posts
- text search functionality
- user karma calculation



Call outs:
- thread contention for upvotes is actually very low; CRDTs not necessary
- we could definitely have a "celebrity problem" or "hot partition" issue in regards to popular subreddits
    - choosing an alternative partition key comes at the trade-off of deep pagination performance due to "scatter-gather"
- Why does "celebrity problem"/"hot partition" not apply to individual posts? hot partitions are more applicable to a "range" of keys, plus volume on individual posts never gets that high
- fan out like twitter? likely not a good idea because the posts jump around (re-order) too much, rather than twitter which should maintain a chronological order



NUMBERS:
- 50M DAU
- 330M MAU
- 21B "screen views" per month
    -> 7,000 TPS (reads, req #3)
- 1.6B "visits" in one month
    -> 533 TPS (reads, req #3)
- 168B "page views" in 2018 (one full year duration)
    -> 4,600 TPS (reads, req #3)
- 32B upvotes in 2019 (one full year duration)
    -> 877 TPS (writes, req #2)
- 199M posts created in 2019 (one full year duration)
    -> 5.45 TPS (writes, req #1)
- 2.8M total subreddits
---
7,000 TPS (reads, req #3)
877 TPS (writes, req #2)
5.45 TPS (writes, req #1)

So, this is going to be read heavy


- top post stats
    - 439k upvotes on top post for all-time
    - 310k upvotes on top post for past year
    - 150k upvotes on top post for past month
    - 149k upvotes on top post for past week
    - 90.5k upvotes on top post for today

So, upvotes come in at an exponential decay
And, even the most viral of posts for the entire site seem to max out at around 1-2 TPS for upvote rate
Thus, there's actually low thread contention for upvotes on posts



Derived secondary numbers:
- 8.6 "page views" per "visit"
    - since at least one of those page views is likely to be of the homepage,
    -> 500 - 850 TPS for the homepage

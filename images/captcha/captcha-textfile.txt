Do you post all the live streams after they are done?








Thanks! How do we also make a request on the topic?






Hi can you pls explain how will it help making uuid as the sort key?
Should it not be the image_url instead? Pls correct me...







this would be something like a natural key: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key
^ using athe url as the key instead of the UUID




why aren't you supposed to do a GROUP BY on an OLTP data store?
"huge key-range queries" = "OLAP stuff"

DDIA has great content on the bottleneck differences of OLTP vs OLAP
OLAP - the bottleneck is HDD scans / disk scans
OLTP - machine I/O






How do we ensure the correctness of user tagged labels?

some websites increase the number of captchas you need to answer before they let you proceed if you keep getting the tags wrong ðŸ˜‚



Sorry I think I missed the first 20 minutes of the zoom. What is the point of designating OLTP vs OLAP data stores. Also with the key isBus - how are we getting that a particular captcha is testing for bus?


OLTP - DynamoDB, Cassandra, Spanner, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch
single record look-ups, or very small key-range queries

OLAP - RedShift, ClickHouse, Snowflake, Druid, Trino
optimized for huge full table scans

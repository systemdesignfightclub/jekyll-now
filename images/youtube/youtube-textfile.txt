Problem Topic:
YOUTUBE




Functional requirements:
- upload a video
- watch a video
(- search for videos)
(- view counts / analytics for videos)




Non-functional requirements:
- high availability (eventual consistency is definitely good enough)
- low latency is pretty important (for video viewing)






Numbers:

800M DAU
5 video views per day on average


1:200
view to upload ratio

300MB on avg. per video


25% video watch rate






**how many views per second?**
"bandwidth"

800M DAU * 5 -> video views per day
= 4B views per day
4B views per day / 100k -> views per second
= 4000M / 0.1M
= 40,000 TPS

So, we have 40,000 views per second



**how much bandwidth do we need (for down)?**
40,000 * (0.25 * 300MB)
40,000 * 75MB
= 10,000 * (300MB)
= 3M. MB
= 3k. GB
= 3 TB

we need 3 TB down per second...



**uploads per day**
4B views per day
1:200 of upload:view ratio
4B / 200 = uploads per day
= 4000M / 200
= 20M uploads per day




**how much upload volume per day?**
20M uploads per day

how much per day?
20M * 300MB per video = volume per day
= 6B MB per day
= 6M GB
= 6k TB
= 6 PB

6PB "UP" per day




**how much upload per second?**
6B MB per day. / 100k
= 6000M MB / 100k
= 60M MB / 1k
= 60k MB per second
= 60 GB per second




**how much video storage?**
how many much do we need for one whole year of video uploads?

6PB "UP" per day * 365
-> 6PB "UP" per day * 333
= 2PB * 3 * 333
= 2PB * 1000
= 2000PB per year
= 2 exabytes of data per year




(then multiple that by 20 for a nice upper bound of all of youtube's total videos)
= 2000PB * 20 per year
= 40,000 PB in total, as an upper bound for 20 years of video content

= 40 exabytes of data

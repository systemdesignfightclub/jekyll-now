SPOTIFY TOP K SONGS



RESOURCES
- Stanley Chiang -- chapter on "most frequently accessed items tracker"
- Donne Martin's primer kinda covers it as "sales rank" -- https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master/solutions/system_design/sales_rank
- Alex Xu Volume II -- Ad Click Aggregator / Metrics Monitoring
- The coverage from the "System Design Interview" youtube channel (Mikhail Smarshchok): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-XDoPjoHw








REQUIREMENTS
- show the K most played songs in the past 24 hours with *REAL-TIME* updates
- record and count the songs as they're being played by end users
- we don't need an exact count for top songs











CHECKLIST:
- [ ] load balancers
- [ ] CDNs?
- [ ] secondary indices?
- [ ] DB schemas
- [ ] partitioning keys, secondary indices
- [ ] NALSD numbers (return to this at end)





















--------------------
LIVE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:






What is cdc with database triggers - how does it work to send from OLTP to OLAP?


"Change Data Capture"
DDIA has some content on it
"Source of Truth" / "System of Record" -- the initial place where data is captured
"read optimized views"

debezium









Will we be doing estimates on total number of servers ? and also total number of DB instances? ..


100k songs played per second

batch up 10 songs at a time in the logs

10k writes per second

NA/SA, europe, asia+australia



5k







1k TPS for listing service






2k transactions per machine on cassandra
10k writes per second, 10 records per write

4k-5k writes at peak

N=3

N+1 is 4 machines












If top K songs are personalised per user, bringing in more parameters like user's previous listens, etc, can we talk about how and where to club all data in "most optimal" approach ?

"personalization" is an MLE topic

WHATSAPP



RESOURCES:
- Grokking
- Alex Xu book 1
- Stanling Chiang's book
- Lewis Lin's book







REQUIREMENTS:
- sending and receiving messages
- joining groups

OUT OF SCOPE:
- presence indicator
- full-text search on messages





3 approaches for receiving messages
- short polling
- long polling
    - Pro: rebalancing complexity is handled for you
    - Con: you still have the complexity of maintaining stateful connection objects
- web sockets

3 approaches for CDC
- DB triggers
- DB subscribed to the broker
- two calls from the send server


2 variations
- small group variation (Today's coverage)
- large group variation






CALL OUT:
- WhatsApp actually does the user list fetch on client-side
- pull-based brokers (kafka) vs push-based (redis pub-sub and RabbitMQ)




--------------------
LIVE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:




What does stateless mean here?
it means that the server maintains "state"
usually state goes in the database






can you explain again why wouldn't long polling be a good approach? It seems it is similar to Websockets approach, pls do correct me....




yes got it thanks, also coming to the fan out part should we not use caching?



quick note for Kafka in CDC - you likely want to optimize for throughput, which will come at the expense of latency (to optimize throughput you'd want to batch data reads)









but joining a group would be write heavy right? Again pls do correct me...
read-heavy because you receive messages more often than you join groups



coz consider a famous person saying top 1k people joining the group would be given great discounted courses/coupons







also for Kafka how would you consider multi-region consistency? As people from different parts of world can be in the same group (sorry a lot of questions by me but would love to know this one)
- we'll have eventual consistency
the concern might be over maintaining ordering of messages
so, yes this could look weird, but you can have the client logic properly order the messages
I think timestamps should come from the server






does WhatsApp support full-text search on messages?
out of scope



--



With every user possible having hundreds of chats and thousands of messages. WhatsApp keeps the backup on user device so it doesn't store or have the state.

Although how does big message service work like fb maybe? Do they save messages to db ?





also for Kafka how would you consider multi-region consistency? As people from different parts of world can be in the same group (sorry a lot of questions by me but would love to know this one)





You can actually tune Kafka to your SLO if you don't want to swap to redis pubsub by tweaking max.poll.records, fetch.max.wait.ms, a couple other ones

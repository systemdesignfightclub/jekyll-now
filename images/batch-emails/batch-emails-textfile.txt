Numbers:
1M emails to send
send them all in under 10 minutes
50kB per email



How many emails per second?
1M / 10 * 60
1,000,000 / 600
1,000,000 / 500
10,000 / 5 = 2,000 emails per second

2,000 emails per second (TPS)






What's the bandwidth?
2,000 emails per second
50kB per email

2000 * 50 kB / second
20,000 * 5
100,000 kB / second
100 MB / second
0.1 GB per second
0.8 Gb per second

1.0 Gb per second is reasonable for one machine's bandwidth on its internet connection








2000 requests per second
16 cores to a CPU

2000 / 16
500 / 4

125 request per second for each core
100 TPS per core

100ms for 100 requests


**each request can only occupy a core for 10ms**
SO, we're CPU/"core" bound





120
if we have 64 cores,
30 requests per second for each core

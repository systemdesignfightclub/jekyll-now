INVENTORY DESIGN




RESOURCES:
- some payment gateway, like stripe






REQUIREMENTS:
- show available items
- track the inventory, as it changes
- inventory changes may occur in distributed transaction performed by other services
  - expose an interface for these distributed transactions
- inventory snapshots and auditing



OUT OF SCOPE:
- ordering itself
- payments
- listings and location look-up


CALL OUTS:
- thread contention (prime day lightning deals)
- large objects issue if too many "holds" get placed







NUMBERS:
- 3.0B "visits" in one month and 10 page views per visit
- 300M items were sold over the course of 2 days for prime day 2022

less important numbers:
- 300M regular customer accounts
- 200M prime accounts
- 12M items from AFN itself
- 350M items when considering 3rd party sellers
- 175 global fulfillment centers
- 10M 3rd party sellers






how many reads?
3B * 10 -> 30B reads per month
30B / 30 -> 1B reads per day

1B / 100k -> reads per second

10,000 reads per second






how many writes?
300M items were sold over the course of 2 days
300M / 2 = 150M items per day


150M / 100k
1,500 items per second


1500 writes per second





strong consistency
1) place a hold on the item
request:
  item_id: abc-123
  count: 2

response:
  defabd-123-defabc



high availability
2) "execute" the hold

request:
  uuid: defabd-123-defabc

response:
  200
